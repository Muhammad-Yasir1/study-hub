Dear 4.1 & 4.2, 
Your task is to create chat app on react with redux and firebase with following options:
1. Chat box will show message and time of msg.
2. Sender can edit the message within 1 minutes of sending.
3. Sender can delete the message within 1 minutes of sending.
4. After 1 minutes message can't be edited or deleted. 
5. Once the receiver sees the message message will double check to sender as 'seen' like what's app.

Due: coming Friday
Happy Coding :)

seen : false }
